## About Tobermory

I am a software engineer from [Brighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton). I studied at [Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk). I now live and work in [Seattle](https://www.seattletimes.com/). For my day job, I write code for what you might call underwater drones. Oh, and I support the [Albion](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/).

## Systems I Build

Oceanographic instruments, such as gliders and floats (we don't actually call them drones), have to
- move up and down in the world's oceans
- collect data from various sensors
- at the surface, get GPS and beam data home using Iridium sat comms
- download further commands for continued operation
- do all the above for years on a single battery pack

## Programming Skills I Have

- Embedded Systems Programming, aka Bare-Metal
- Real-time Operating Systems
- Network Programming (sockets)
- Iridium Sat Comms (SBD and Dial-up)
- Cryptography (AES, RSA, Stream ciphers, One-time pads)
- Data compression 
- Data visualization (JFreeChart)
- Simulations/Models

## Protocols I Have Used

- TCP/IP
- HTTP
- IMAP
- I2C
- RS232/485

## Technologies Of Choice
- Unix
- C, Java, bash
- regex
- make, maven
- git, semver

## Also Dabbled With
- C++
- ARM Cortex M Assembler
- Reverse Engineering
- Code Generation (Antlr Grammars)
- cron
