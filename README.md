## About Tobermory

I am a software engineer from [Brighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton). I studied at [Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk). I now live and work in [Seattle](https://www.seattletimes.com/). For my day job, I design, test and deploy code for what you might call underwater drones. Oh, and I support the [Albion](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/).

## Systems I Build

Oceanographic instruments, such as gliders and floats (we don't actually call them drones), have to
- move up and down in the world's oceans
- collect data from various sensors
- at the surface, beam data home using Iridium sat comms
- download further commands for continued operation
- do all the above for years on a single battery pack

## Programming Skills I Have

- Embedded Systems Programming, aka Bare-Metal
- Real-time Operating Systems
- Iridium Sat Comms (SBD and Dial-up)
- Underwater Acoustic Communications
- Cryptography (AES, RSA, Stream ciphers, One-time pads)
- Data compression 
- Data visualization (JFreeChart)
- Simulations/Models
- Geospatial (Maps, Projections)
- Network Programming (sockets)

## Programming Idioms I Have Invented Or Applied

### Executive
A time-ordered event queue, enabling time to be used as a file descriptor. Realizes a single-threaded concurrent programming model where a simple main loop can listen to I/O from many devices simultaneously while also servicing timed (esp I/O timeout) actions. Multi-threaded programming, just say no.

### State Machines
An API for structured conversations with (mostly serial/rs232) devices. Builds upon the Executive, adding regular expressions, resulting in a clean, powerful and verifiable method for device interfacing. We all draw state machines on the whiteboard. This API translates those diagrams directly into code.

### Fragmentation/Assembly
Applied the fragmentation/assembly technique in the IP protocol (OSI model layer 3) to both underwater data transfer using acoustic modems and to Iridium Short-Burst Data (SBD) data transfer. In both domains, the data to be sent (layers down to 4) is larger than can be handled by the data/physical layer (layer 2). 

### Cron
Used the crontab event scheduling syntax as the method by which pilots control data acquisition on remote, rarely-connected, systems. 

## Protocols I Have Used

- TCP/IP
- HTTP
- IMAP
- I2C
- RS232/485

## Technologies I Prefer
- Environment: Unix
- Languages: C, Java, bash
- Tools: regex
- Build: make, maven
- Versioning: git, [semver](https://semver.org/)

## Things I Have Also Dabbled With
- C++
- ARM Cortex M Assembler
- Reverse Engineering (HexRays, IDA)
- Parsers and Code Generation (Antlr, lex+yacc)
- cron
